## Quick Start

I use go 1.24.0 to run the code.

```bash
go run main.go

# or

./run.sh
```

## Architecture

- `main.go` is the entry point of the program.
- `infra/` contains the mock database and data layer.
- `model/` defines the data structure and methods.
- `service/` contains the business logic.
- `interface/` contains the command line interface.
